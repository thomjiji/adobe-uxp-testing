# Starter Premiere Plugin (Vanilla)

This starter plugin is a good place to get started when developing for Premiere Pro. It does not rely on any frameworks or build steps -- hence the name "Vanilla".

## Load into Premiere Pro

Make sure Premiere Pro is up and running first. First, add the plugin to the "Developer Workspace" in the UXP Developer Tools (UDT) application.

- If you selected "Create Plugin..." earlier, it will have already be there with the plugin ID and name you specified.
- Otherwise, click "Add Plugin" and select the `manifest.json` file in the corresponding plugin folder.

Click the ••• button next to the corresponding workspace entry, and click "Load". Switch over to Premiere Pro, and the plugin's panel will be running.
